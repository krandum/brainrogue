# Brainrogue
by Pablo Alatorre

## What is Brainrogue?
A console based roguelike where the player enters commands to navigate a dungeon.

## How does it work?
Players will queue up commands and then hit enter. Every time they enter an action however, they lose a sanity point, and once you are out of sanity you will start to quickly lose health. Thus, the player needs to think ahead and queue up as many commands as possible to save their sanity. Run through dungeons with the little information you have, level up, and be smart!

## Features to come
	* Monsters with at least A* pathfinding that can attack the player with learnable attack patterns
	* Items the player can pick up to improve their stats as well as add commands they can enter
	* Command logic structures, like loops for your actions with break conditions. This is a programmer's game.
	* Different levels with progressively complicated structures.
	* Room variety.
	* Action log to track pick-ups, monster kills, and other relevant information.
	* Game over screen, with compile flag to disable it (for testing purposes).
